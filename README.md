# Train-Simulator

This project simulates the parking break system of a train.

It was developed during my summer internship at Critical Software during the week at the HIS department (High Integraty Systems).

**Quick walkthrough (also explained in the Help menu [press H]):**

To get started turn the vehicle ON [press V]. This enables the control of the parking break system.

To release the parking break multiple options are available: eigther press the release parking break button at cabine 1 [press 1] or cabine 2 [press 2] (if this cabine is available). Alternatively, remotely connect to the train through Line #11 and release the parking breaks. One other way to do it is to enable the WTB UIC communication protocol between cars and then increase the parking break pipe pressure.
